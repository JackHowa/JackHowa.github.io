  <p>Jack is a software engineer at Realnets, a web consulting firm, in Chicago. One of his side projects is an iOS delayed
    photo-sharing app called Latr. That app on the App Store began as a final project for Dev Bootcamp (DBC), a 19-week coding
    bootcamp. At DBC, he learned full-time professional web development, including Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>

  <p>Jack was the web intern at NPR-member station WBEZ 91.5 FM. He made infographics using civic data for daily and enterprise
    stories. Jack also curated stories and playlists online. </p>

  <p>Before joining WBEZ, he was a reporter for public radio station KBIA, in Columbia, Missouri. Jack graduated from the Missouri
    School of Journalism in 2016. The Chicagoland native is back at the station after attending the Vocalo Storytelling Workshop
    in 2012. </p>

  <p>He is a happy learner who&rsquo;s aggressively curious. A well-crafted narrative with bizarre sounds truly revs his engines.
    Details, group edits, and revisions make great things. He produces data and radio stories and data plus sound stories,
    or sonifications. </p>

  <p>He has contributed radio stories to NPR-member stations KBIA, WYFI, and WBEZ. The recent Missouri journalism grad produced
    data visualizations and interactives for the Columbia Missourian and Global Journalist. A sonification of data was made
    for Investigative Reporters and Editors Radio. </p>

  <p>Jack led a student app development team to win a Public Media Platform-sponsored competition in 2014. The app My2Cents
    Radio asked younger listeners give their two cents on public media content by giving minimum 2&cent; micro-donations
    to particular stories. Stations receive money and listener data. Jack's team won &quot;Best Use Of The PMP API&quot;
    at a Google- and KQED-sponsored school competition for HereSay. The app uses geolocation to help new visitors to a city
    find relevant stories &ndash; and the coolest taco place. </p>

  <p>Jack is an award-winning sound designer. There's three plays for University of Missouri under his belt. His 138 sound cues
    for Argonautika won a Kennedy Center American College Theater regional award for sound design in 2015. </p>

  <p>In his free time, Jack likes running, reading, practicing meditation, and listening to movies and radio. He's a certified
    podcast fiend with more than 200 shows in the feed. Follow him on Twitter. Then, if you download his favorite podcatcher
    app, Overcast, you can see and chat about shared favorite episodes. That's the dream, right.</p>
